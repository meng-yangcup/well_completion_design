# well_completion_design
Dear readers :

This is the course-work for my well completion design. The content of this operation is mainly cementing design, design cementing hydraulic parameters, selection 
and optimization of pump trucks. This course design is only a teaching case, and I am only a beginner, too few factors are considered to be applied on-site. If 
anyone is interested in this, you can communicate with me. My email address: my2000cup@gmail.com;

Anyone can study or comment via me, but donâ€™t copy the assignment directly.

I will not work hard to check github and gmail every day. Please forgive me for not being able to reply you quickly.

Regards!

Yang
